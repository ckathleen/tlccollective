    <div class="about">
                “TLC” is an investment collective comprised of Terri Burns, Lauren Stephanian, and Casey Caruso. Given our backgrounds in computer science, engineering and product, we pride ourselves in angel investing in tech-forward founders who are building the inevitable. We write small, collective checks (having done a handful of investments to date) and work closely with founding teams.
